This is my custom width and height map carousel plugin<br>
js:$('.myCarousel').myCarousel(w,h);<br>
Note: the default value is 1 W 640px h; the default value is 270px; you can customize the carousel figure's width and height<br>
2 should be written UL and ol<br>
3 if you help, I hope you can look at star, grateful...	<br>
